# Wannacry Reverse Engineering using Ghidra


This project describes the process of reverse engineering the WannaCry ransomware, which spread worldwide in 2017. Reverse engineering is the process of taking apart software to understand how it works. In this case, the reverse engineering was performed in order to understand how WannaCry works, and to develop tools to decrypt it.

Reverse Engineering Process:

The WannaCry reverse engineering was performed using a number of tools and approaches. First, I downloaded a copy of the software from the internet. Then, I used a debugger to step through the execution of the software and observe the values of the variables. In addition, I used a disassembler to convert the software's machine code into assembly language. Assembly language is a more human-readable form of code. Finally, I used a decompiler to convert the assembly language back into C language, which is the most common programming language for Windows applications.
