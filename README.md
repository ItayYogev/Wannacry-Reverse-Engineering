## Wannacry Reverse Engineering using Ghidra

This project outlines the process of reverse engineering the WannaCry ransomware, a notorious malware that spread worldwide in 2017. Reverse engineering involves dissecting software to comprehend its functionality. In this case, the reverse engineering was undertaken to understand WannaCry's inner workings and to create tools for decryption.

### Reverse Engineering Process:

The WannaCry reverse engineering involved a combination of tools and methodologies. Initially, I obtained a copy of the software from the internet. Subsequently, I employed a debugger to step through the software's execution, examining variable values. Additionally, a disassembler was used to convert the software's machine code into assembly language, providing a more human-readable format. Finally, a decompiler was utilized to revert the assembly language back into C language, the prevalent programming language for Windows applications.
